# **Detailed Documentation of Machine Learning Workflow**

## **1. Introduction**
This report provides a comprehensive analysis of a machine learning workflow implemented in the Jupyter Notebook. The notebook focuses on predictive modeling using a dataset (`MLE-Assignment.csv`) and employs various preprocessing, feature selection, modeling, evaluation, and interpretability techniques. 

### **Objectives:**
- Perform **data preprocessing** (handling missing values, scaling, and feature selection).
- Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to visualize data distributions.
- Implement and evaluate **machine learning models** (Random Forest Regressor).
- Interpret model results using **feature importance, SHAP, and LIME**.

## **2. Problem Statement**

### **Situation:**
A dataset with multiple features is provided, and the goal is to build an effective predictive model that can provide accurate results based on historical data.

### **Task:**
- Clean and preprocess the dataset to remove inconsistencies.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key patterns.
- Train a machine learning model and evaluate its performance.
- Interpret the results using explainability techniques.

### **Action Taken:**

#### **2.1 Data Preprocessing**
- **Importing Required Libraries:** Essential libraries were imported for handling data, visualization, and machine learning.
- **Loading the Dataset:** The dataset was read and examined for its structure and composition.
- **Checking Data Properties:**
  - Shape of the dataset was determined.
  - Missing and duplicate values were identified and handled.
  - Feature selection was performed to retain relevant columns.
